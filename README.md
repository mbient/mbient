### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a automation enthusiast with a passion for scripting and programming. I
enjoy writing code in languages like C, Rust, and Go, and I'm always looking
for ways to simplify tasks and make them more efficient.

Currently, I'm also exploring the world of NixOS, a fascinating operating
system that offers a unique approach to package management and system
configuration.

When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with new projects or learning
about the latest developments in the tech world. I'm excited to share my
experiences and knowledge with the GitHub community, and I look forward to
collaborating with others who share my interests.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories and projects, and let's connect
if you're working on something interesting!
